NOTE: As mentioned I dont have enough exposure to code in JS with WDIO.
So I have implemented the Step defs for the first 3 scenarios in JAVA. 
Also I have mentioned that I dont have any API automation experience yet 
but I am currently learning RestAssured framework for API automation. 
So I need more time to implement the 4th and the 5th scenario.
